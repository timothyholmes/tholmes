# Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website. My goal for the site was to be as concise as possible, for the sake of clarity and load times. At one point this was written mostly in AngularJS, and while it looked neat- it was slow as all get out. The new site is written with only HTML and CSS. Only 6 images are used, and it is consistent across all reasonable screen sizes.
